Execute the following Python linting tools in the specified order and resolve ALL identified issues:

**Primary Linters (MUST fix all issues):**
1. `poetry run pyright --project pyrightconfig.strict.json .`
2. `poetry run mypy .`

**Secondary Linters (fix when possible):**
3. `poetry run pylint .`
4. `poetry run sourcery review --verbose --no-summary . | cat`

**Critical Requirements:**
- **NEVER ignore** any issues reported by `pyright` or `mypy`
- Fix ALL type checking errors, missing imports, undefined variables, and type annotations
- Address `pylint` issues unless they conflict with type checker requirements
- For `sourcery` suggestions: implement improvements where feasible, but these are optional

**Execution Guidelines:**
- Run linters in the exact order listed above
- Fix issues from each linter before proceeding to the next
- Re-run each linter after fixes to ensure no new issues were introduced
- Provide a summary of what was fixed for each tool

**Forbidden Actions:**
- Using `# type: ignore` comments for mypy/pyright issues
- Adding pylint disable comments without justification
- Skipping type annotations or proper imports

Complete all fixes and confirm clean linter output before finishing.
