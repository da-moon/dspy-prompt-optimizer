# Cursor Rules Management

## Rule Organization
- Use numbered prefixes: `001_`, `002_`, etc. for load order
  - `001-099`: Core workspace rules (alwaysApply: true)
  - `100-199`: Python development rules
  - `200-299`: Testing and quality rules
  - `300-399`: Tooling and environment rules
  - `400-499`: Architecture and organization rules

## File Format Requirements
```yaml
---
description: Clear, concise description under 120 characters
globs: "**/*.py"  # or appropriate file patterns
alwaysApply: false  # true only for core workspace rules
---
```

## Rule Content Guidelines
- Keep rules atomic and focused on single concerns
- Maximum 500 lines per rule (target much less)
- Use concrete examples and anti-patterns
- Write actionable, testable requirements
- Avoid vague guidance - be specific

## Creating New Rules
1. Use `/Generate Cursor Rules` command after defining behavior in chat
2. Follow the numbering convention
3. Include appropriate globs for file targeting
4. Test rule effectiveness with AI interactions
5. Keep descriptions machine-readable for AI agent selection

## Rule Types
- **Always**: `alwaysApply: true` - included in all contexts
- **Auto Attached**: `globs` patterns - triggered by matching files
- **Agent Requested**: `description` provided - AI decides when to use
