## Introduction to DSPy

DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Prompting) is a framework for programming with
foundation models. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, DSPy allows you to:

1. **Declare what you want** rather than how to get it
2. **Optimize prompts automatically** based on examples or metrics
3. **Compose complex pipelines** of language model calls
4. **Improve performance systematically** through teleprompters and optimizers

DSPy was developed by researchers at Stanford, and it represents a significant
advancement in how we interact with and optimize language models.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher (but less than 3.13 due to dependency constraints)
- Poetry (dependency management tool)

### Installing Poetry

If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it following the
[official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):

**On Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL):**

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dspy-prompt-optimizer.git
   cd dspy-prompt-optimizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

This will:

- Create a virtual environment for the project
- Install all required dependencies
- Install development dependencies if you add the `--with dev` flag

### Dependency Notes

DSPy has complex dependency requirements which are handled automatically by
Poetry. The project's `pyproject.toml` file specifies the exact version
constraints needed for compatibility.

### Using pyenv

Since this project requires Python >=3.10,<3.13, you may need to use pyenv to
manage Python versions if your system Python is incompatible (e.g., Python
3.13+).

1. Install pyenv if not already installed:

   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS
   curl https://pyenv.run | bash

   # Add to your shell configuration (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
   echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Install a compatible Python version:

   ```bash
   # List available Python versions
   pyenv install --list | grep " 3.1[0-2]"

   # Install a specific version (e.g., Python 3.12.7)
   pyenv install 3.12.7
   ```

3. Configure Poetry to use the installed Python version:

   ```bash
   # Verify available Python versions
   pyenv versions

   # Configure Poetry to use a specific Python version
   poetry env use 3.12.7

   # Verify Poetry environment configuration
   poetry env info
   ```

This ensures that Poetry creates a virtual environment with a Python version
compatible with the project requirements.

## Usage

The DSPy Prompt Optimizer can be used as a command-line tool:

```bash
# Basic usage (reads from stdin, outputs to stdout)
cat your_prompt.txt | poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer

# Specify input and output files
poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer your_prompt.txt -o optimized_prompt.txt

# Choose optimization approach
poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer your_prompt.txt -t example

# Enable verbose output
poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer your_prompt.txt -v
```

### Command-line Options

- `INPUT_PROMPT`: File containing the prompt to optimize (defaults to stdin)
- `--output, -o`: Output file for the optimized prompt (defaults to stdout)
- `--model, -m`: Model to use for optimization (defaults to
  claude-3-7-sonnet-latest)
- `--api-key, -k`: Anthropic API key (can also be set via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  environment variable)
- `--optimization-type, -t`: Type of optimization to perform: self, example, or
  metric (defaults to self)
- `--verbose, -v`: Enable verbose output

## Using Poetry Commands

Poetry provides a streamlined way to work with Python packages and
dependencies. Here's how to use Poetry with DSPy Prompt Optimizer:

### Running Commands

Poetry automatically manages the virtual environment for you. To run the tool,
use:

```bash
# Run the tool using Poetry
poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer [arguments]
```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

If you prefer to activate the virtual environment and then run commands
directly:

```bash
# Activate the Poetry virtual environment
poetry shell

# Now you can run the tool directly
dspy-prompt-optimizer [arguments]

# When finished, exit the Poetry shell
exit
```

### Managing Dependencies

Poetry automatically handles all dependencies based on the `pyproject.toml`
file:

```bash
# Add a new dependency
poetry add package-name

# Add a development dependency
poetry add --group dev package-name

# Update dependencies
poetry update
```

### Available Scripts

The following scripts are available through Poetry:

```bash
# Run the main prompt optimizer
poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer
```

## Understanding DSPy Concepts

DSPy introduces several key concepts that make it powerful for prompt
optimization:

### 1. Signatures

Signatures in DSPy define the inputs and outputs of language model operations.
They're like function signatures but for LM interactions:

```python
class PromptRefiner(dspy.Signature):
    """Refine a prompt to make it more effective."""

    prompt = dspy.InputField(desc="The original prompt that needs refinement")
    analysis = dspy.OutputField(desc="Analysis of the prompt's strengths and weaknesses")
    improved_prompt = dspy.OutputField(desc="A refined version of the prompt")
```

This declarative approach allows DSPy to understand what you want from the
model.

### 2. Modules

DSPy modules are the building blocks that use signatures to perform specific
tasks:

- **Predict**: Simple prediction based on a signature
- **ChainOfThought**: Adds reasoning steps before producing outputs
- **MultiChainOfThought**: Generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the
  best one

Example:

```python
refiner = dspy.Predict(PromptRefiner)  # Simple prediction
refiner = dspy.ChainOfThought(PromptRefiner)  # With reasoning steps
```

### 3. Optimizers

Optimizers (formerly called Teleprompters) are DSPy's optimization engines.
They take examples and metrics to improve module performance:

```python
# Example of using a DSPy optimizer
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot
optimizer = BootstrapFewShot(max_bootstrapped_demos=3)
compiled_module = optimizer.compile(module=refiner, trainset=examples, metric=my_metric)
```

This process automatically generates better prompts based on the examples and
metrics provided.

### 4. LM Configuration

DSPy abstracts away the specifics of different LM providers, making it easy to
switch between them:

```python
lm = dspy.LM('anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest', api_key="your-api-key")
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

## Optimization Approaches

This tool implements three different approaches to prompt optimization:

### 1. Self-Refinement

The self-refinement approach uses the language model to analyze and improve its
own prompts. It:

- Analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the original prompt
- Generates an improved version addressing the identified issues
- Does not require examples or metrics

This is the simplest approach and works well for many use cases.

### 2. Example-Based Optimization

Example-based optimization uses examples of good prompts to guide the
improvement process:

- Learns patterns from examples of original prompts and their improved versions
- Applies these patterns to new prompts
- Requires curated examples of good prompt transformations

This approach is more powerful when you have specific examples of the kinds of
improvements you want.

**Note:** In the current implementation with DSPy 2.6.23, the example-based
optimization approach has compatibility issues due to API changes in DSPy. This
is documented as a known limitation and may require updates as DSPy evolves.

### 3. Metric-Based Optimization

Metric-based optimization iteratively improves prompts based on quantifiable
metrics:

- Defines metrics like clarity, specificity, and actionability
- Generates candidate improvements and evaluates them
- Keeps the best-performing version
- Can run for multiple iterations to progressively improve

This approach is the most sophisticated and can achieve the best results with
sufficient iterations.

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for optimizing a prompt for Claude Sonnet 3.7:

1. Start with a basic prompt idea:

   ```
   I have noticed thinking LLMs such as Claude Sonnet 3.7 tend to have tendencies to go down rabbit holes, go on sidequests and loose the original mission statement; they often blow out the scope of the request and make things a lot more complicated; It's like they have ADHD and OCD at the same time;

   Are there any research, academic or enthusiast based on this? have researchers or the community been able to come up with battle-tested prompts (user or system prompt) to deal with this behaviour and get the LLMs that have built-in chain of thought to focus? based on recent advancements in prompt engineering and other comminuty and researcher work, present me a "Rule" (prompt) for this matter
   ```

2. Save this to a file:

   ```bash
   echo "Your prompt text..." > original_prompt.txt
   ```

3. Run the optimizer:

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer original_prompt.txt -o optimized_prompt.txt -t metric -v
   ```

4. Review the optimized prompt in `optimized_prompt.txt`

5. Try different optimization approaches to compare results:
   ````bash
   poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer original_prompt.txt -o optimized_self.txt -t self -v
   poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer original_prompt.txt -o optimized_example.txt -t example -v
   poetry run dspy-prompt-optimizer original_prom   ```
   ````

## Build and Packaging

Poetry makes it eas

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

If you encounter errors related to the API key:

- Ensure you've set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable or passed it
  with `-k`
- Verify the API key is valid and has not expired
- Check for any whitespace or special characters that might have been copied
  with the key

### Poetry Issues

If you encounter issues with Poetry:

- **Poetry installation fails**: Refer to the
  [official installation documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- **Dependency resolution takes too long**: Try
  `poetry add packagename --no-update` and then run `poetry update` separately
- **Virtual environment not activating**: Use `poetry env info` to debug
  environment issues
- **Unknown command errors**: Ensure you're running Poetry commands from the
  project root directory
- **Version conflicts**: Check your `pyproject.toml` file for dependency
  version constraints

### Dependency Issues

### Python Version Compatibility

If you encounter Python version compatibility issues:

- **Error message**: "The currently activated Python version X is not supported
  by the project (>=3.10,<3.13)"

- **Solution**:

  1. Install a compatible Python version using pyenv:
     ```bash
     pyenv install 3.12.7  # or any version between 3.10 and 3.12
     ```
  2. Configure Poetry to use this version:
     ```bash
     poetry env use 3.12.7
     ```
  3. Check your Poetry environment configuration:
     ```bash
     poetry env info
     ```
  4. List all Poetry environments:
     ```bash
     poetry env list
     ```

- **Prevention**: Always check the Python version requirements in
  `pyproject.toml` before setting up the project. This project requires
  Python >=3.10,<3.13.
